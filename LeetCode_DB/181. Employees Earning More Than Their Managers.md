Using SELF JOIN!

[SQL Fiddle Example Schema](http://sqlfiddle.com/#!9/b19bf1/12)


**Creating a Schema on MySQL5.6 from SQL Fiddle**

```sql
CREATE TABLE Employee (
    Id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
    Name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    Salary INT NOT NULL,
    ManagerId VARCHAR(50),
    Primary KEY (Id) )
;
INSERT INTO Employee
    (Id, Name, Salary, ManagerId)
VALUES
    ('1', 'Joe', 70000, '3'),
    ('2', 'Henry', 80000, '4'),
    ('3', 'Sam', 60000, 'None'),
    ('4', 'Max', 90000, 'None')
;

```


--> Make sure to experiment with ***ON*** clause.
--> Difference between: (used LEFT JOIN to visualize better)
1)
```sql
LEFT JOIN Employee e2
ON e1.ManagerId = e2.Id
```

AND

2)
```sql
LEFT JOIN Employee e2
ON e2.ManagerId = e1.Id
```

It looks like the table
