### Status:
Complete (Accepted)

### Question:
Write a SQL query to get the second highest salary from the Employee table.


### Solution(s):

**Potential Solution 1**

```SQL
SELECT MAX(Salary) AS SecondHighestSalary
FROM Employee
WHERE Salary < (SELECT MAX(Salary) FROM Employee)
```
Note: Can also use NOT IN instead of <

**Problem:**

Works for the second highest salary.
However, won't be scalable to other "***n<sup>th<sup>*** highest" types of questions.

------

**Potential Solution 2**

```SQL
SELECT DISTINCT Salary AS SecondHighestSalary
FROM Employee
ORDER BY Salary DESC
LIMIT 1 OFFSET 1
```

**Problem:**
Above query will fail if there is only one record in the table! (if there is no such thing as ***second highest***)


-----

**Ideal Solution**


```SQL
SELECT
    (SELECT DISTINCT Salary
        FROM Employee
        ORDER BY 1 DESC
        LIMIT 1
        OFFSET 1) AS SecondHighestSalary
```


### Notes / Hints / Links:

Using **DISTINCT** to return unique salary values and also using subqueries to deal with null cases.
