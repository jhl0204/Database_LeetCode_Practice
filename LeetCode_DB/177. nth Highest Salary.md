### Number #177

### Status:
Complete (Accepted)

### Question:
Write a SQL query to get the nth highest salary from the Employee table.


### Solution(s):

**Default Template**

```SQL
CREATE FUNCTION getNthHighestSalary(N INT) RETURNS INT
BEGIN
  RETURN (
      # Write your MySQL query statement below.

  );
END
```

**Solution**

```SQL
CREATE FUNCTION getNthHighestSalary(N INT) RETURNS INT
BEGIN

declare m int;  -- need to declare the variable type
set m = N-1;  -- variable assignment

  RETURN (
      SELECT DISTINCT salary
      FROM Employee
      ORDER BY salary DESC
      LIMIT m, 1
  );
END
```
Notes:  
**LIMIT** takes two arguments
- LIMIT(offset, max rows to return)
- offset: numerical value that represents the number of rows from the very first row. For example `offset` of the first row is 0 not 1.

**Other Solutions From the Internet**

```SQL
SELECT Salary as SecondHighestSalary
FROM
    (SELECT Salary
    FROM Employee
    ORDER BY salary DESC
    LIMIT 2) as Emp
ORDER BY Salary
LIMIT 1;
```

Notes:
- Change *2* from above to N and you'll be able to get the N<sup>th</sup> highest value. But as the original solution suggests, much scalable if we use a function with *N* as input!
- Remember that SQL is filtering database using set theory.
    - the inner query returns the top highest values for N (2 in this case) in a descending order
    - the outer query returns a single value in an **ascending** order, giving us the last value from the results of the inner query.

"in order to find the N<sup>th</sup> highest salary, we just find the salary that has exactly N-1 salaries greater than itself."
