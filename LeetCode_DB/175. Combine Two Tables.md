### Number #175

### Status:
Complete (Accepted)

### Question:
Write a SQL query for a report that provides the following information for each person in the Person table, ***regardless*** if there is an address for each of those people:

`FirstName, LastName, City, State`


### Solution(s):

```SQL
SELECT FirstName, LastName, City, State
FROM Person p
LEFT JOIN Address a
ON p.PersonId = a.PersonId  
```


### Notes / Hints:
Because the question specifically states 'REGARDLESS', should use **LEFT OUTER JOIN** (which is same as **LEFT JOIN**), in order to account for cases where there is no address information for every person.
