### Question:
Suppose that a website contains two tables, the Customers table and the Orders table. Write a SQL query to find all customers who never order anything.

### Solution(s):

```sql
SELECT c.Name as Customers
FROM Customers c
LEFT JOIN Orders o
ON c.Id = o.CustomerId
WHERE o.CustomerId IS NULL

```


### Notes / Hints / Links:

Hints:
`LEFT (OUTER) JOIN` will return null for values where customers didn't order anything. Once we get table, we can filter for the `NULL` values, which is the answer.
