Write a SQL query to find all duplicate emails in a table named Person.

### Solution(s):

```sql
SELECT Email
FROM Person
GROUP BY Email
HAVING count(Email) > 1

Note: `HAVING` is the "clean" way to filter a query that has been aggregated.
\- From [Mode SQL](https://mode.com/sql-tutorial/sql-having/)

`WHERE` can't be used with aggregate functions (`GROUP BY`)
